`balanced`: code for experiments on balanced datasets with base models

`balanced-modified`: code for experiments on balanced datasets with base models having 1 more fully-connected layer

`unbalanced`: code for experiments on unbalanced datasets with base models

`unbalanced-modified`: code for experiments on unbalanced datasets with base models having 1 more fully-connected layer

# Running the codes

Unzip the [FMD dataset](http://people.csail.mit.edu/celiu/CVPR2010/FMD/FMD.zip) and copy `image/` directory to each of the 4 folders listed above. (Or change the `data_dir` path in the codes to the correct path to `image/`)
